# Simple Punchcard App
A Reddit-powered open-source Android app.

## Goal

From the reddit thread:

* Record my in/out time in a very simple, user-friendly way.
* Break down my average hourly earning based on my salary. Have this average update automatically as I record my time each day.
* Email me my timesheet weekly with a breakdown of the hours, hourly average, and possibly the daily job description.

## Who
Anybody who wants to participate may. Post in the reddit thread to request access to the repo. You can fork and issue pull requests, though with such a small project it'd be easier to have all the development in one place. 

Add any contributer name/email address to the readme

You can help via coding, cleaning up this document, creating app assets (icons, market description and images, etc), or by debugging and help with testing.

## Project Suggestions
* Don't push untested code to the master branch-- create a feature branch for extended work on a specific item and then merge back to master when it seems to be good
* Squash (rebase) local commits ONLY. Use this to tiddy up before merging back to master if you have messy commits
* Only edit docs on the master branch

## Development Suggestions

* Subclass the Application class and keep all global logic, state, and data there
* Activity classes should only contain UI logic and interface with the underlying Application or other data/model objects
* Do as much UI design as possible via XML and inflate the layout/resource in the code

## Application Design

### Classes

### User Interface

### Settings

### Graphical Assets
