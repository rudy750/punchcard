## Want to help?

Anybody who wants to participate is welcome to contribute. Post in the Reddit thread to request access to the repo or message bvalosek on GitHub. You can fork and issue pull requests, though with such a small project it'd be easier to have all the development in one place. 

You can help via coding, cleaning up this document, creating app assets (icons, market descriptions and images, etc), or by debugging and help with testing.
